      <p> Hi my name is Purity. This is a website I created for the Girls who code self-paced program called Behind my Eyes.Behind my Eyes to me describes all the challenges people face with a smile on their faces and one would never guess that there's something wrong. I came up with this name  due to an episode I had some time ago. I have a journal where I write my thoughts down when ever I was motivated to and I would like to share the thought that motivated the name. </p>
      
      <h2>Behind my Eyes</h2>
      
      <p>" When I close my eyes sometimes it’s a dark, peaceful, calm place for me to savor, and sometimes it’s a dark and scary place that makes me wonder about the point of my existence. Sometimes I love to close my eyes and enjoy the calm and sometimes the ruckus is too much that I never want to close my eyes. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?. Because behind all of my sight mechanisms is the very thing that wants to wipe my existence"</p>
