    <h2> Your Mind matters!</h2>
    <p>Mental health issues are very prevalent in today’s world as it should not be so and there are so many people who need  help but they can’t get due to all of the misconceptions about mental health. Behind my eyes means everything that is going on anywhere else in one body apart from the eyes. Everything that is happening is legit and we should not be told otherwise when help can be administered. Mental health influences our quality of life so it equally as important to take care of it like our physical health. </p>
